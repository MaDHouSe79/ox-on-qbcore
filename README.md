# NOTO
- All credits go the the owner of ox_inventory resources, i'm just a dev that make this resources works again for qbcore, because there are quite a few servers that use ox_inventory but are on qb-core.
- Here a snippet to make it work again with qb-core, read all readme files because i'm not going to help you, this snippet has no support.
