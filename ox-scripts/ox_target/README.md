A performant and flexible standalone "third-eye" targeting resource, with additional functionality for supported frameworks.

ox_target is the successor to qtarget, which was a mostly-compatible fork of bt-target.
To improve many design flaws, ox_target has been written from scratch and drops support for bt-target/qtarget standards, though partial compatibility is being implemented where possible.


```lua
exports.ox_target:SpawnPed({
    model = 'a_m_m_indian_01',
    coords = vector4(901.34, -170.06, 74.08, 228.81),
    minusOne = true,

    target = {
        options = {

                event = 'qb-taxijob:client:requestcab',

        },
